- `booking_chat_messages`
- `booking_chats`
- `chat_messages`
- `chats`

**Migration File:** `database/migrations/2025_10_24_120000_drop_chat_tables.php`

## Verification Steps

To verify the removal was successful:

1. **Check for remaining chat references:**
   ```bash
   grep -r "openBookingChat" resources/views/
   grep -r "ChatController" app/
   grep -r "use App\\Models\\Chat" app/
   ```

2. **Verify routes:**
   ```bash
   php artisan route:list | grep -i chat
   ```

3. **Check database:**
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate:status
   ```

4. **Test the application:**
   - Visit professional booking page - no chat column should appear
   - Visit customer appointment page - no chat column should appear
   - No JavaScript errors in console

## Notes

- All chat-related functionality has been completely removed
- The application should function normally without any chat features
- No database data was preserved (all chat messages, conversations, etc. were deleted)
- If you need to restore chat functionality in the future, you would need to recreate all the components from scratch
